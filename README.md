This document provides an overview of several fundamental data structures included in this IDE project. Each data structure is briefly described, highlighting its primary use case and a real-world example of where it might be applied.

## Binary Tree

- **TL;DR**: A hierarchical structure where each node has up to two children, useful for organized storage and efficient searches.
- **Real-world example**: A company's organizational structure, where each division is a node with potential sub-divisions as children.

## Node

- **TL;DR**: An individual element containing data and links in a data structure like a linked list or tree.
- **Real-world example**: A single task in a project management application, which can have dependencies (links) to other tasks.

## Binary Search Tree Node

- **TL;DR**: A node in a binary search tree where each node has up to two children ordered in a way to enable efficient search.
- **Real-world example**: An index in a database system, which facilitates quick search and retrieval of records.

## Deque

- **TL;DR**: A double-ended queue that allows insertion and removal from both ends, providing a hybrid of stack and queue.
- **Real-world example**: A deck of cards where you can draw from both the top and the bottom.

## Graph

- **TL;DR**: A collection of nodes connected by edges representing relationships, applicable for both directed and undirected relationships.
- **Real-world example**: A network diagram, illustrating the connections between different network devices.

## Heap

- **TL;DR**: A specialized tree-based structure that satisfies the heap property, used for priority queues.
- **Real-world example**: Managing airline flights based on departure time priority.

## Linked List

- **TL;DR**: A sequence of nodes where each node points to the next, allowing efficient insertion and deletion.
- **Real-world example**: A to-do list, where tasks can be added and completed in varying order.

## Singly Linked List

- **TL;DR**: A linked list where each node points only to the next node, making it efficient for unidirectional traversing.
- **Real-world example**: A one-way train line where each station is a node with a single track to the next station.

## Doubly Linked List

- **TL;DR**: An extension of a singly linked list where nodes have references to both the next and the previous nodes.
- **Real-world example**: A music playlist where you can skip forward to the next song or go back to the previous one.


## Map

- **TL;DR**: A collection of key-value pairs that allows for efficient retrieval of data based on a unique key.
- **Real-world example**: A user database where each account's username is mapped to its user details.

## Hash (Hash Table/Hash Map)

- **TL;DR**: A structure that maps keys to values using a hash function to efficiently find the desired data slot.
- **Real-world example**: A caching system where data is retrieved using unique identifiers (keys).

## Pair

- **TL;DR**: A simple structure holding two related data elements together.
- **Real-world example**: A key-value pair in a configuration setting, where one relates to the other.

## Priority Queue

- **TL;DR**: An abstract data type similar to a regular queue but with each element additionally having a "priority" associated with it.
- **Real-world example**: Hospital emergency room triaging, where patients are served based on the severity of their conditions.

## Queue

- **TL;DR**: A FIFO (First In, First Out) structure, ideal for managing tasks in sequential order.
- **Real-world example**: Customers lining up to check out at a grocery store.

## Set

- **TL;DR**: A collection of distinct objects, typically used to ensure the uniqueness of elements.
- **Real-world example**: A membership registry where each member's ID is unique.

## Stack

- **TL;DR**: A LIFO (Last In, First Out) structure, used to reverse things or peel back layers one at a time.
- **Real-world example**: A stack of plates in a cafeteria, where the last plate placed on top is the first one to be taken off.


Understanding these data structures and their applications is fundamental to designing effective algorithms and systems, enhancing the capability to store, organize, and retrieve data efficiently.
