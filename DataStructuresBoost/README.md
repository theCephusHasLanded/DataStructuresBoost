# Data Structures Overview

![data structure tldr](image.png)
This document provides an overview of several fundamental data structures included in this IDE project. Each data structure is briefly described, highlighting its primary use case and a real-world example of where it might be applied.

## Binary Tree
![I've created a technical drawing of a binary tree data structure, highlighting its symmetrical branching pattern with labeled nodes for clarity.](image-1.png)
- **TL;DR**: A hierarchical structure where each node has up to two children, useful for organized storage and efficient searches.
- **Real-world example**: A company's organizational structure, where each division is a node with potential sub-divisions as children.

## Node
![Here's a technical drawing of a node data structure, highlighting its components such as data and, if applicable, pointers to other nodes.](image-7.png)
- **TL;DR**: An individual element containing data and links in a data structure like a linked list or tree.
- **Real-world example**: A single task in a project management application, which can have dependencies (links) to other tasks.

## Binary Search Tree Node

This visual helps illustrate how each node in a binary search tree can connect to its children, demonstrating the hierarchical structure of the tree.](image-16.png)
- **TL;DR**: A node in a binary search tree where each node has up to two children ordered in a way to enable efficient search.
- **Real-world example**: An index in a database system, which facilitates quick search and retrieval of records.

## Deque
![Here's a technical drawing of a deque (double-ended queue) data structure, illustrating the capability to add or remove elements from both ends.](image-9.png)
- **TL;DR**: A double-ended queue that allows insertion and removal from both ends, providing a hybrid of stack and queue.
- **Real-world example**: A deck of cards where you can draw from both the top and the bottom.

## Graph
![Here's a technical drawing of a graph data structure, showcasing a variety of nodes and connections to illustrate the flexibility and complexity of graph structures.](image-11.png)
- **TL;DR**: A collection of nodes connected by edges representing relationships, applicable for both directed and undirected relationships.
- **Real-world example**: A network diagram, illustrating the connections between different network devices.

## Heap
![Here's a technical drawing of a heap data structure, showing a complete binary tree that maintains the heap property, with nodes labeled to reflect a potential arrangement.](image-10.png)
- **TL;DR**: A specialized tree-based structure that satisfies the heap property, used for priority queues.
- **Real-world example**: Managing airline flights based on departure time priority.

## Linked List
![Here's an artistic representation of a linked list data structure, showing a series of nodes arranged horizontally, each connected by arrows. This visualization highlights how each node points directly to the next, encapsulating the essence of a linked list.](image-15.png)
- **TL;DR**: A sequence of nodes where each node points to the next, allowing efficient insertion and deletion.
- **Real-world example**: A to-do list, where tasks can be added and completed in varying order.

## Singly Linked List
![Here's a technical drawing of a singly linked list data structure, showing a linear arrangement of nodes with pointers indicating the sequence.](image-5.png)
- **TL;DR**: A linked list where each node points only to the next node, making it efficient for unidirectional traversing.
- **Real-world example**: A one-way train line where each station is a node with a single track to the next station.

## Doubly Linked List
![Here's a technical drawing of a doubly linked list data structure, showing nodes with pointers to both the next and previous nodes in the sequence.](image-6.png)
- **TL;DR**: An extension of a singly linked list where nodes have references to both the next and the previous nodes.
- **Real-world example**: A music playlist where you can skip forward to the next song or go back to the previous one.

## Map
![Here's a technical drawing of a map data structure, illustrating the key-value pairs and their connections in a structured manner.](image-2.png)
- **TL;DR**: A collection of key-value pairs that allows for efficient retrieval of data based on a unique key.
- **Real-world example**: A user database where each account's username is mapped to its user details.

## Hash (Hash Table/Hash Map)
![Here's a visual representation of a hash table data structure, showing how keys are organized into buckets using a hash function. This artistic depiction illustrates the concept clearly with keys being hashed and directed into specific slots.](image-14.png)
- **TL;DR**: A structure that maps keys to values using a hash function to efficiently find the desired data slot.
- **Real-world example**: A caching system where data is retrieved using unique identifiers (keys).

## Pair
![Here's a technical drawing of a pair data structure, depicting its two connected elements labeled as 'first' and 'second'.](image-3.png)
- **TL;DR**: A simple structure holding two related data elements together.
- **Real-world example**: A key-value pair in a configuration setting, where one relates to the other.

## Priority Queue
![Here's a technical drawing of a priority queue data structure, illustrating elements arranged by their priority for processing.](image-12.png)
- **TL;DR**: An abstract data type similar to a regular queue but with each element additionally having a "priority" associated with it.
- **Real-world example**: Hospital emergency room triaging, where patients are served based on the severity of their conditions.

## Queue
![Here's a technical drawing of a queue data structure, showcasing the FIFO principle through a linear sequence of elements.](image-8.png)
- **TL;DR**: A FIFO (First In, First Out) structure, ideal for managing tasks in sequential order.
- **Real-world example**: Customers lining up to check out at a grocery store.

## Set
![Here's a technical drawing of a set data structure, showing a collection of unique elements within a single container, highlighting the uniqueness of each element.](image-4.png)
- **TL;DR**: A collection of distinct objects, typically used to ensure the uniqueness of elements.
- **Real-world example**: A membership registry where each member's ID is unique.

## Stack
![Here's a technical drawing of a stacked linked list data structure, showing elements stacked vertically in a LIFO order with pointers indicating the sequence.](image-13.png)
- **TL;DR**: A LIFO (Last In, First Out) structure, used to reverse things or peel back layers one at a time.
- **Real-world example**: A stack of plates in a cafeteria, where the last plate placed on top is the first one to be taken off.


Understanding these data structures and their applications is fundamental to designing effective algorithms and systems, enhancing the capability to store, organize, and retrieve data efficiently.
